# Distribution apps and calculators

These are live apps that update in your browser. They cover a variety of
distribution applications. Some are designed mainly to be instructional. Others,
like most of the protection apps, are useful for real enginnering.

## Protection

- [Conductor slapping](mdpad.html?conductor_slapping.md)
- [IEEE 1584 arc flash](mdpad.html?1584.md)
- [Arc flash in a padmounted switch](mdpad.html?arc_flash_padsw.md)
- [Burndown on overhead conductors](mdpad.html?burndown.md)

## Impedances and voltage drop

- [Overhead line impedance calculator](mdpad.html?impedances.md)
- [Voltage drop on a line section](voltage-drop)
- [Cable capacitance](mdpad.html?cable_capacitance.md)
- [CVR: customer vs. utility savings](mdpad.html?cvr.md)
- [Voltage impacts of a distributed generator](mdpad.html?dg.md)

## Grounding, coupling, and faults

- [Neutral-to-earth voltages (stray voltage)](mdpad.html?StrayVoltage.md)
- [Circulating currents on underground cables](mdpad.html?CableCirculatingCurrents.md)
- [Coupling to telephone circuits](mdpad.html?phone_coupling.md)
- [Fault simulator with various transformer connections](fault-simulator)

## Transients

- [Lightning protection of overhead lines using EPRI-OpenETran](mdpad_local.html?OpenETran.md)
- [Lightning protection of underground cables](mdpad.html?lightning_cable.md)
- [Lightning transients on a tapped underground cable](mdpad.html?cable_transients.md)
- [Ferroresonance on 5-legged core transformers](mdpad.html?ferro.md)
- [Transients on urban primary systems](mdpad.html?UrbanPrimary.md)

Right now, many of these are beta quality. **Use caution! No warranty!**
These apps work best with a recent version of Firefox or Chrome. Most
of them will work with version 11 of Internet Explorer, albeit with a
few quirks; only a few of the apps work with Internet Explorer 9 or
earlier versions. Most apps should work on modern tablets and phones.
